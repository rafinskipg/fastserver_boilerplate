#My snippet for a plug&play server for testing things
-------------------------------------------------

Just add a "app" folder and add your code inside. Then do "grunt server" for running it.

It needs refactoring for the livereload, etc, but is a Grunt file, do it on your own. You have tons of examples out there.
